    "### Section 6 Preface – *The Lab Coat and the Magnifying Glass: Making Bugs Boring*\n",
    "\n",
    "Great software doesn’t spring fully‑formed from a developer’s head; it crawls out dripping with bugs, typos, and half‑baked assumptions. What separates professional code from the weekend hack isn’t super‑human genius—it’s a relentless feedback loop of **testing** and **debugging** that shrinks “I have a hunch” into “I am sure.” This module hands you the lab coat and magnifying glass so that failures become fascinating puzzles rather than Friday‑night panic attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why tests turn hope into confidence  \n",
    "Writing code without tests is like building a bridge and skipping the stress test because the paint looks nice. Maybe users will cross safely; maybe they’ll plunge into the river. Automated tests give you a safety net that fires in seconds—not after an angry email. They also democratise understanding: a well‑named test reads like living documentation, explaining edge cases long after coffee‑powered context has faded. You’ll learn how to sculpt a **unit test** that isolates one tiny behaviour, string several together into an **integration test**, and finally drive the whole stack like a user with an **end‑to‑end** scenario. We’ll show why the trusty `pytest` assert beats print‑and‑pray, how fixtures keep setup tidy, and why parametrisation is the Swiss‑army knife for covering dozens of cases with three lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The art of catching ghosts  \n",
    "Even with tests, bugs wriggle through gaps—especially the sneaky intermittent ones that pass on your laptop but fail on CI at 3 a.m. Here’s where **debugging discipline** shines. We’ll practise reading a traceback top‑to‑bottom until it feels like following breadcrumb directions, drop into `pdb` or a VS Code breakpoint without fear, and build nose‑for‑smell heuristics: if a test is flaky, suspect a race; if logs explode with Unicode gibberish, eyeball encodings. You’ll discover why stepping through code beats staring at it, and why a single well‑placed `print(f\"DEBUG {var=}\")`—deleted later, of course—can shortcut two hours of head‑scratching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tooling as superpower  \n",
    "Modern Python hands you power tools: **coverage reports** that paint red lines where tests never tread, **Hypothesis** to stress‑test with thousands of generated inputs, **`pytest‑benchmark`** to guard performance budgets, and static analysis that flags errors without running a byte. We’ll weave these into a narrative of Continuous Integration, showing how to automate the boring bits so reviewers focus on logic, not indentation. You’ll script flaky‑test detectors, artefact uploads, and even a one‑command `git bisect run pytest` to pinpoint the exact commit that broke the build.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging as mindset  \n",
    "Most importantly, this module aims to shift your emotional stance toward failure. A red test is not a judgment; it’s a data point. A crashing script isn’t a disaster; it’s a flashlight illuminating an assumption. We’ll cultivate the scientific method: form a hypothesis, create the minimal reproduction, run, observe, refine. That calm, methodical rhythm is the hallmark of senior engineers—and it’s teachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the final notebook you’ll wield assertions, mocks, breakpoints, coverage graphs, and log captures like a carpenter flips between saw and chisel. Bugs will still appear—software is complexity carved into silicon, after all—but you’ll greet them with the quiet satisfaction of someone who knows exactly where they put the magnifying glass.\n"
